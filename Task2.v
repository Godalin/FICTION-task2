(** Part 1. Regular Expressions *)

Inductive reg_exp (T : Type) : Type :=
  | EmptySet
  | EmptyStr
  | Char (t : T)
  | App (r1 r2 : reg_exp T)
  | Union (r1 r2 : reg_exp T)
  | Star (r : reg_exp T).

Arguments EmptySet {T}.
Arguments EmptyStr {T}.
Arguments Char {T} _.
Arguments App {T} _ _.
Arguments Union {T} _ _.
Arguments Star {T} _.

(** Note that this definition is _polymorphic_: Regular
    expressions in [reg_exp T] describe strings with characters drawn
    from [T] -- that is, lists of elements of [T].

    (Technical aside: We depart slightly from standard practice in
    that we do not require the type [T] to be finite.  This results in
    a somewhat different theory of regular expressions, but the
    difference is not significant for present purposes.) *)

(** We connect regular expressions and strings via the following
    rules, which define when a regular expression _matches_ some
    string:

      - The expression [EmptySet] does not match any string.

      - The expression [EmptyStr] matches the empty string [[]].

      - The expression [Char x] matches the one-character string [[x]].

      - If [re1] matches [s1], and [re2] matches [s2],
        then [App re1 re2] matches [s1 ++ s2].

      - If at least one of [re1] and [re2] matches [s],
        then [Union re1 re2] matches [s].

      - Finally, if we can write some string [s] as the concatenation
        of a sequence of strings [s = s_1 ++ ... ++ s_k], and the
        expression [re] matches each one of the strings [s_i],
        then [Star re] matches [s].

        In particular, the sequence of strings may be empty, so
        [Star re] always matches the empty string [[]] no matter what
        [re] is. *)

(** We can easily translate this informal definition into an
    [Inductive] one as follows.  We use the notation [s =~ re] in
    place of [exp_match s re].  (By "reserving" the notation before
    defining the [Inductive], we can use it in the definition.) *)

Reserved Notation "s =~ re" (at level 80).

Inductive exp_match {T} : list T -> reg_exp T -> Prop :=

Example reg_exp_ex2 : [1; 2] =~ App (Char 1) (Char 2).
Proof.
  apply (MApp [1]).

(** (Notice how the last example applies [MApp] to the string
    [[1]] directly.  Since the goal mentions [[1; 2]] instead of
    [[1] ++ [2]], Coq wouldn't be able to figure out how to split
    the string on its own.)

    Using [inversion], we can also show that certain strings do _not_
    match a regular expression: *)

Example reg_exp_ex3 : ~ ([1; 2] =~ Char 1).

(** We can define helper functions for writing down regular
    expressions. The [reg_exp_of_list] function constructs a regular
    expression that matches exactly the list that it receives as an
    argument: *)

Fixpoint reg_exp_of_list {T} (l : list T) :=
  match l with
  | [] => EmptyStr
  | x :: l' => App (Char x) (reg_exp_of_list l')
  end.

(** We can also prove general facts about [exp_match].  For instance,
    the following lemma shows that every string [s] that matches [re]
    also matches [Star re]. *)

Lemma MStar1 :
  forall T s (re : reg_exp T) ,

    exactly the same shape expected by [MStarApp].) *)

(** Since the definition of [exp_match] has a recursive
    structure, we might expect that proofs involving regular
    expressions will often require induction on evidence. *)

(** For example, suppose we want to prove the following intuitive
    result: If a regular expression [re] matches some string [s], then
    all elements of [s] must occur as character literals somewhere in
    [re].

    To state this as a theorem, we first define a function [re_chars]
    that lists all characters that occur in a regular expression: *)

Fixpoint re_chars {T} (re : reg_exp T) : list T :=
  match re with
  | EmptySet => []
  | EmptyStr => []
  | Char x => [x]
  | App re1 re2 => re_chars re1 ++ re_chars re2

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** The [remember] Tactic *)

(** One potentially confusing feature of the [induction] tactic is
    that it will let you try to perform an induction over a term that
    isn't sufficiently general.  The effect of this is to lose
    information (much as [destruct] without an [eqn:] clause can do),
    and leave you unable to complete the proof.  Here's an example: *)

Lemma star_app: forall T (s1 s2 : list T) (re : reg_exp T),
  s1 =~ Star re ->
  s2 =~ Star re ->
  s1 ++ s2 =~ Star re.
Proof.
  intros T s1 s2 re H1.

(** Now, just doing an [inversion] on [H1] won't get us very far in
    the recursive cases. (Try it!). So we need induction (on
    evidence!). Here is a naive first attempt.

    (We can begin by generalizing [s2], since it's pretty clear that we
    are going to have to walk over both [s1] and [s2] in parallel.) *)

  generalize dependent s2.

        |s1 re1 re2 Hmatch IH|re1 s2' re2 Hmatch IH
        |re''|s1 s2' re'' Hmatch1 IH1 Hmatch2 IH2].

(** But now, although we get seven cases (as we would expect
    from the definition of [exp_match]), we have lost a very important
    bit of information from [H1]: the fact that [s1] matched something
    of the form [Star re].  This means that we have to give proofs for
    _all_ seven constructors of this definition, even though all but
    two of them ([MStar0] and [MStarApp]) are contradictory.  We can
    still get the proof to go through for a few constructors, such as
    [MEmpty]... *)

  - (* MEmpty *)
    simpl. intros s2 H. apply H.

(** ... but most cases get stuck.  For [MChar], for instance, we
    must show

      s2     =~ Char x' ->
      x'::s2 =~ Char x'

    which is clearly impossible. *)

  - (* MChar. *) intros s2 H. simpl. (* Stuck... *)
Abort.

(** The problem here is that [induction] over a Prop hypothesis
    only works properly with hypotheses that are "completely
    general," i.e., ones in which all the arguments are variables,
    as opposed to more complex expressions like [Star re].

    (In this respect, [induction] on evidence behaves more like
    [destruct]-without-[eqn:] than like [inversion].)

    A possible, but awkward, way to solve this problem is "manually
    generalizing" over the problematic expressions by adding
    explicit equality hypotheses to the lemma: *)

Lemma star_app: forall T (s1 s2 : list T) (re re' : reg_exp T),
  re' = Star re ->
  s1 =~ re' ->
  s2 =~ Star re ->
  s1 ++ s2 =~ Star re.

(** We can now proceed by performing induction over evidence
    directly, because the argument to the first hypothesis is
    sufficiently general, which means that we can discharge most cases
    by inverting the [re' = Star re] equality in the context.

    This works, but it makes the statement of the lemma a bit ugly.
    Fortunately, there is a better way... *)
Abort.

(** The tactic [remember e as x] causes Coq to (1) replace all
    occurrences of the expression [e] by the variable [x], and (2) add
    an equation [x = e] to the context.  Here's how we can use it to
    show the above result: *)

Lemma star_app: forall T (s1 s2 : list T) (re : reg_exp T),
  s1 =~ Star re ->
  s2 =~ Star re ->
  s1 ++ s2 =~ Star re.

(** **** Exercise: 5 stars, advanced (weak_pumping)

    One of the first really interesting theorems in the theory of
    regular expressions is the so-called _pumping lemma_, which
    states, informally, that any sufficiently long string [s] matching
    a regular expression [re] can be "pumped" by repeating some middle
    section of [s] an arbitrary number of times to produce a new
    string also matching [re].  (For the sake of simplicity in this
    exercise, we consider a slightly weaker theorem than is usually
    stated in courses on automata theory -- hence the name
    [weak_pumping].)

    To get started, we need to define "sufficiently long."  Since we
    are working in a constructive logic, we actually need to be able
    to calculate, for each regular expression [re], the minimum length
    for strings [s] to guarantee "pumpability." *)

(* ================================================================= *)
(** ** Part 2. Advanced Task: A Verified Regular-Expression Matcher *)

(** We have now defined a match relation over regular expressions and
    polymorphic lists. We can use such a definition to manually prove that
    a given regex matches a given string, but it does not give us a
    program that we can run to determine a match automatically.

    It would be reasonable to hope that we can translate the definitions
    of the inductive rules for constructing evidence of the match relation
    into cases of a recursive function that reflects the relation by recursing
    on a given regex. However, it does not seem straightforward to define
    such a function in which the given regex is a recursion variable
    recognized by Coq. As a result, Coq will not accept that the function
    always terminates.

    Heavily-optimized regex matchers match a regex by translating a given
    regex into a state machine and determining if the state machine
    accepts a given string. However, regex matching can also be
    implemented using an algorithm that operates purely on strings and
    regexes without defining and maintaining additional datatypes, such as
    state machines. We'll implement such an algorithm, and verify that
    its value reflects the match relation. *)

(** We will implement a regex matcher that matches strings represented
    as lists of ASCII characters: *)
Require Import Coq.Strings.Ascii.

Definition string := list ascii.

(** The Coq standard library contains a distinct inductive definition
    of strings of ASCII characters. However, we will use the above
    definition of strings as lists as ASCII characters in order to apply
    the existing definition of the match relation.

    We could also define a regex matcher over polymorphic lists, not lists
    of ASCII characters specifically. The matching algorithm that we will
    implement needs to be able to test equality of elements in a given
    list, and thus needs to be given an equality-testing
    function. Generalizing the definitions, theorems, and proofs that we
    define for such a setting is a bit tedious, but workable. *)

(** The proof of correctness of the regex matcher will combine
    properties of the regex-matching function with properties of the
    [match] relation that do not depend on the matching function. We'll go
    ahead and prove the latter class of properties now. Most of them have
    straightforward proofs, which have been given to you, although there
    are a few key lemmas that are left for you to prove. *)

    [App re0 re1] matches [a::s] iff [re0] matches the empty string

    use it later. *)

    [a::s] matches [Star re] iff [s = s0 ++ s1], where [a::s0] matches
    [re] and [s1] matches [Star re]. Like [app_ne], this observation is
    critical, so understand it, prove it, and keep it in mind.

    Hint: you'll need to perform induction. There are quite a few
    reasonable candidates for [Prop]'s to prove by induction. The only one
    that will work is splitting the [iff] into two implications and
    proving one by induction on the evidence for [a :: s =~ Star re]. The
    other implication can be proved without induction.

    In order to prove the right property by induction, you'll need to
    rephrase [a :: s =~ Star re] to be a [Prop] over general variables,
    using the [remember] tactic.  *)

(** The definition of our regex matcher will include two fixpoint
    functions. The first function, given regex [re], will evaluate to a

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, standard (match_eps_refl)

    Now, prove that [match_eps] indeed tests if a given regex matches
    the empty string.  (Hint: You'll want to use the reflection lemmas
    [ReflectT] and [ReflectF].) *)

(** We'll define other functions that use [match_eps]. However, the

    over these functions is [match_eps_refl]. *)

(** The key operation that will be performed by our regex matcher will
    be to iteratively construct a sequence of regex derivatives. For each
    character [a] and regex [re], the derivative of [re] on [a] is a regex
    that matches all suffixes of strings matched by [re] that start with
    [a]. I.e., [re'] is a derivative of [re] on [a] if they satisfy the
    following relation: *)

Definition is_der re (a : ascii) re' :=
  forall s, a :: s =~ re <-> s =~ re'.

(** A function [d] derives strings if, given character [a] and regex
    [re], it evaluates to the derivative of [re] on [a]. I.e., [d]
    satisfies the following property: *)
Definition derives d := forall a re, is_der re a (d a re).





(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, standard (derive)

    Define [derive] so that it derives strings. One natural

    regex's match the empty string. *)

(** The [derive] function should pass the following tests. Each test
    establishes an equality between an expression that will be
    evaluated by our regex matcher and the final value that must be
    returned by the regex matcher. Each test is annotated with the
    match fact that it reflects. *)

(** **** Exercise: 4 stars, standard (derive_corr)

    Prove that [derive] in fact always derives strings.

    Hint: one proof performs induction on [re], although you'll need
    to carefully choose the property that you prove by induction by
    generalizing the appropriate terms.

    Hint: if your definition of [derive] applies [match_eps] to a
    particular regex [re], then a natural proof will apply
    [match_eps_refl] to [re] and destruct the result to generate cases
    with assumptions that the [re] does or does not match the empty
    string.

    Hint: You can save quite a bit of work by using lemmas proved
    above. In particular, to prove many cases of the induction, you
    can rewrite a [Prop] over a complicated regex (e.g., [s =~ Union
    re0 re1]) to a Boolean combination of [Prop]'s over simple
    regex's (e.g., [s =~ re0 \/ s =~ re1]) using lemmas given above
    that are logical equivalences. You can then reason about these
    [Prop]'s naturally using [intro] and [destruct]. *)

(** We'll define the regex matcher using [derive]. However, the only
    property of [derive] that you'll need to use in all proofs of

(** A function [m] _matches regexes_ if, given string [s] and regex [re],
    it evaluates to a value that reflects whether [s] is matched by

(** **** Exercise: 3 stars, standard (regex_match_correct)

    Finally, prove that [regex_match] in fact matches regexes.

    Hint: if your definition of [regex_match] applies [match_eps] to
    regex [re], then a natural proof applies [match_eps_refl] to [re]
    and destructs the result to generate cases in which you may assume
    that [re] does or does not match the empty string.

    Hint: if your definition of [regex_match] applies [derive] to
    character [x] and regex [re], then a natural proof applies
    [derive_corr] to [x] and [re] to prove that [x :: s =~ re] given
    [s =~ derive x re], and vice versa. *)
